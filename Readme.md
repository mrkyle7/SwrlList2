# Swrl List 2

This app is in very early stage development.

# What is it?

An app where you can quickly add things to your Swrl List to remember to Watch, Read or Listen to them later.

You can currently add films, books, TV shows, podcasts, apps, video games, boardgames, music albums, websites - all in one place!

Details of the items will be stored in your list automatically to help you remember why you saved it!

Recommend them to your friends - a recommendation from a friend is much more valuable than a rating from strangers! See their response and comments to your recommendations and feel proud that you got them to Watch, Read or Listen to it!

Swrl  - You Should Watch, Read or Listen!

# Developement details

This app is written and built with [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)

To get started, follow the [Android](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html) and [iOS](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/index.html) guides.

Run the usual `npm install` and `cordova prepare` then (as per the guides above) `cordova emulate android` to run in an Android emulator or use Xcode to run on iOS.

`openXcode.sh` is a helper script to launch Xcode for this project. 

N.B. When running in iOS, run `cordova prepare ios` to ensure your latest changes are built.
